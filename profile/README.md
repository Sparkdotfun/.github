**SPARK**

The Instant Launchpad for the Next Wave of Builders

Spark is a permissionless launchpad that enables anyone on Solana to create and launch their own token in seconds. It offers a sustainable, transparent framework where keyholders are protected from capital loss, and builders can bootstrap real communities — fast, fair, and without middlemen.

Key Features Instant Token Launches Deploy tokens effortlessly with just a transaction — no technical background required.

Holder Protection Sustainable asset redistribution ensures keyholders retain value and aren't exposed to sudden capital loss.

Modular & Open Fully compatible with Solana-native tooling and designed for future extensibility.

Community-First Design No hidden fees, no centralized control — full ownership stays with creators and their communities.

Problem & Solution Launching tokens today is messy — often locked behind private deals, technical barriers, and predatory contracts. Spark solves this with a unified, transparent launchpad where anyone can participate without needing insider access or complex setups.

By simplifying token creation and protecting builders, Spark unlocks fair and scalable access to launching on Solana.
